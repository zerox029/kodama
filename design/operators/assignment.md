# AssignmentExpression operators

## Overview

| Operator | Description                              |
|----------|------------------------------------------|
| `=`      | AssignmentExpression                     |
| `+=`     | Arithmetic addition and assignment       |
| `-=`     | Arithmetic substraction and assignment   |
| `*=`     | Arithmetic multiplication and assignment |
| `/=`     | Arithmetic division and assignment       |
| `%=`     | Arithmetic modulo and assignment         |

## AssignmentExpression

Used as `a = b`, the value of `b` is evaluated and put into the variable `a`. `a` can only be a variable.

## Arithmetic addition and assignment

Used as `a += b`, the value of `b` is evaluated and added to `a`.

## Arithmetic substraction and assignment

Used as `a -= b`, the value of `b` is evaluated and substracted to `a`.

## Arithmetic multiplication and assignment

Used as `a *= b`, the value of `b` is evaluated and multiplied to `a`.

## Arithmetic division and assignment

Used as `a /= b`, the value of `b` is evaluated and divided to `a`.

## Arithmetic modulo and assignment

Used as `a %= b`, the value of `b` is evaluated and moduloed to `a`.
