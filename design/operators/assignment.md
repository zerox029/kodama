# Assignment operators
## Overview
| Operator | Description                              |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `=`      | Assignment                               |
| `+=`     | Arithmetic addition and assignment       |
| `-=`     | Arithmetic substraction and assignment   |
| `*=`     | Arithmetic multiplication and assignment |
| `/=`     | Arithmetic division and assignment       |
| `%=`     | Arithmetic modulo and assignment         |

## Assignment
Used as `a = b`, the value of `b` is evaluated and put into the variable `a`. `a` can only be a variable.

## Arithmetic addition and assignment
Used as `a += b`, the value of `b` is evaluated and added to `a`.

## Arithmetic substraction and assignment
Used as `a -= b`, the value of `b` is evaluated and substracted to `a`.

## Arithmetic multiplication and assignment
Used as `a *= b`, the value of `b` is evaluated and multiplied to `a`.

## Arithmetic division and assignment
Used as `a /= b`, the value of `b` is evaluated and divided to `a`.

## Arithmetic modulo and assignment
Used as `a %= b`, the value of `b` is evaluated and moduloed to `a`.
