# Arithmetic operators

## Overview

| Operator | Description    |
| -------- | -------------- |
| `+`      | Addition       |
| `-`      | Substraction   |
| `*`      | Multiplication |
| `/`      | Division       |
| `^`      | Exponential    |
| `%`      | Modulo         |
| `++`     | Increment      |
| `--`     | Decrement      |

## Addition
Performs an arithmetic addition between operands `a` and `b` such that `a + b = c`

## Substraction
Performs an arithmetic substraction between operands `a` and `b` such that `a - b = c`

## Multiplication
Performs an arithmetic multiplication between operands `a` and `b` such that `a * b = c`

## Division
Performs an arithmetic division between operands `a` and `b` such that `a / b = c`

## Division
Performs an arithmetic exponential between operands `a` and `b` such that `a^b = c`


## Modulo
Performs an arithmetic division between operands `a` and `b` such that `a % b = c`

## Increment
Increases the operand `a` by 1 such that `a++ = a + 1` and `++a = a + 1`. When placed to the left of the operand, the value of `a + 1` is evaluated. When placed to the right of the operand, the value of `a` is evaluated first, then `a` is incremented.

## Decrement
Decreases the operand `a` by 1 such that `a-- = a + 1` and `--a = a - 1`. When placed to the left of the operand, the value of `a - 1` is evaluated. When placed to the right of the operand, the value of `a` is evaluated first, then `a` is decremented.
